1- If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the value of x after the calculation? 

The answer is '1' because the Remainder operator(%) return the division remainder.
 x = 7
 x = x % 3 => that means we can subtract 3 two times from 7. The remainder is 7-(3*2) = 1.

/*
2-If y equals 21, and the only other statement is y = y % 4, what would be the value of y after the calculation?
  
The answer is '1' because we can subtract 4 five times from 21 and there will be 1 left(the remainder 21-(4*5) = 1)
 */

/*
3-If z equals 13, and the only other statement is z = z % 2, what would be the value of z after the calculation?

The answer is '1' because 13/2 = (2*6)+1 the remainder is 1.
    let z = 13;
    z = z % 2;
    console.log(z); the output will be 1
